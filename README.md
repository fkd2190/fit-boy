Description

How to use
Firstly you will be greeted by a login/register screen, if you do not have an account you can create one by registering then proceed to login. In the game you will see a player icon on the map and 4 tabs at the bottom of the screen. The Profile tab will display your players level and completed quests, the quests tab will allow you to accept any new quests, the friends tab lets you add other people, and the settings tab allows you change your email/password. Clicking on a quest will draw a route from your character to the destination, getting to the destination will reward the character with xp, filling the xp bar will level up your character allowing you to do higher level quests. Watch out for radiation zones on the map, entering these zones will reward you with double xp if you venture out to them. The top right of the screen displays the current weather and clicking on the icon will bring up more details.
